# Development of a System for Recognizing Digits and Handwritten Characters in Images through Supervised Learning

This project focuses on developing a system that can recognize digits and handwritten characters using various supervised learning techniques, including machine learning models such as **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Random Forest**, and **deep learning** techniques like **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**.

The system is trained on datasets like **MNIST** and **EMNIST** for digit and character recognition, respectively, and aims to achieve high accuracy in classifying these handwritten characters.

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a system for recognizing handwritten digits and characters. The primary goal is to use various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to classify images of handwritten characters. This system can be applied to numerous fields, such as postal code reading, digit recognition for checks, and more.

The system implements multiple machine learning algorithms:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**

These algorithms will be trained on datasets, such as MNIST for digit recognition and EMNIST for handwritten character recognition.

## Datasets

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   - The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9).

2. **EMNIST Dataset**:
   - The EMNIST dataset is an extended version of MNIST that contains 814,255 characters from handwritten text, including uppercase and lowercase letters.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms will be used in this project to build the recognition system:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
   - A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies new data points based on the closest training data points.

2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:
   - A supervised learning model that finds the hyperplane which best divides the data into different classes.

3. **Random Forest**:
   - An ensemble learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and merges their results for better accuracy and stability.

4. **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**:
   - A type of artificial neural network used for classification tasks, particularly effective for recognizing complex patterns in images.

## Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions out of total predictions.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positives.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

Additionally, confusion matrices and classification reports are used for in-depth evaluation.
